# FixturePal

An amateur sports application which will create the match schedule for a league of X teams. It doesn't matter whether there's an odd number of teams or an even number; the app can handle both scenarios (as seen in League.java). 

Once a result is entered, the data is stored in a league table and the teams are shifted up and down as per the match outcomes.

The user also has the ability to create match reports detailing interesting match events (goals, cards, injuries etc). 

To get it up and running, clone the project, open in IntelliJ IDEA and then run the MainController.java file.
