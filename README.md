# FixturePal
Targeted at amateur sports fans, athletes or facility supervisors, this application (using Java, Velocity, Spark, Hibernate, HTML, PSQL, and CSS) can automatically generate an entire season of matches for user-defined teams. Driven by a standard round robin algorithm which creates pairings, the program is able to accommodate both even and odd numbers of teams; in the latter case, the dummy data generated by the program is completely hidden. Results data - obtained through user input - is stored in a league table.
